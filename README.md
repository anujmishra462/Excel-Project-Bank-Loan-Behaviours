# Excel-Project-Bank-Loan-Behaviours
I’m excited to share this! 🎉<br>
This project helps banks and financial institutions find out which customers pay on time and who may delay or miss payments. 🕒💳 <br>
By using Excel functions, filters, and clear visual dashboards, the data gives simple and useful insights. 📊✨<br>
This helps banks make smarter decisions and improve their recovery process. 💡🏦💰<br>
